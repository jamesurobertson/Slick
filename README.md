## Slick at a Glance
Slick is a fullstack workplace communication app modeled after Slack that is built on the PERN Stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node).
Users can chat with each other in different channels or send direct messages to one another. For this app, I decided to build it using a rest api backend so the chatting is not in real time. In a future update I would like to convert all of my api calls to utilizing web sockets.

* Send messages to different channels / Direct message users
* Create and join channels
* Change channel Titles
* Edit or delete your own messages
* Register a new account or use the Demo Log in

## Technologies Used
